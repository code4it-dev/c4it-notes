Downloading files from an online source and saving them in the local machine seems an easy task.

And guess what? It is!

In this article, we will learn how to download an online file, perform some operations on it - such as checking its file extension - and store it in a local folder.

## How to download a file stream from an online resource using HttpClient

Ok, this is easy. If you have the file URL, it's easy to just download it using `HttpClient`.

```cs
HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();
Stream fileStream = await httpClient.GetStreamAsync(fileUrl);
```

Clearly, using `HttpClientFactory` is preferred, as we've already explained [in a previous article](https://code4it.dev/csharptips/use-httpclientfactory-instead-of-httpclient/).

But, ok, it looks easy - way too easy! There are two more parts to consider.

### How to handle errors while downloading a stream of data

You know, shit happens!

There are at least 2 cases that stop you from downloading such file: the file does not exist or the file requires authentication.

In both cases, an `HttpRequestException` exception is throw, with the following stack trace:

```plaintext
at System.Net.Http.HttpResponseMessage.EnsureSuccessStatusCode()
at System.Net.Http.HttpClient.GetStreamAsyncCore(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
```

As you can see, **we are implicitly calling `EnsureSuccessStatusCode`** while getting the stream of data.

You can the tell the consumer that we were not able to download the content in two ways: throw a *custom* exception or return `Stream.Null`. We will use `Stream.Null` for the sake of this article.

So, let me refactor out the part that downloads the file stream in a standalone method:

```cs
async Task<Stream> GetFileStream(string fileUrl)
{
	HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();
	try
	{
		Stream fileStream = await httpClient.GetStreamAsync(fileUrl);
		return fileStream;
	}
	catch (Exception ex)
	{
		return Stream.Null;
	}
}
```

so that we can use `Stream.Null` to check for the existance of the stream.

## How to store a file in your local machine

Now we have our stream of data. We need to store it somewhere.

We will need to copy our input stream to a `FileStream` object, placed within a `using` block.

```cs
using (FileStream outputFileStream = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Create))
{
    await fileStream.CopyToAsync(outputFileStream);
}
```

### Possible errors and considerations

When creating the `FileStream` instance, we have to pass the constructor both the full path of the image, with also the file name, and `FileMode.Create`, which tells the stream what type of operations should be supported.

`FileMode` is an enum coming from the `System.IO` namespace, and has different values. Each value fits best for some use cases.

```cs
public enum FileMode
{
	CreateNew = 1,
	Create,
	Open,
	OpenOrCreate,
	Truncate,
	Append
}
```

Again, there are some edge cases that we have to consider:

- **the destination folder does not exist**: you will get an `DirectoryNotFoundException` exception. You can easily fix it by calling `Directory.CreateDirectory` to generate all the hierarchy of folders defined in the path;
- **the destination file already exists**: depending on the value of `FileMode`, you will see a different behavior. `FileMode.Create` overwrites the image, while `FileMode.CreateNew` throws an `IOException` in case the image already exists.

## Full Example

It's time to put the pieces together:

```cs
async Task DownloadAndSave(string sourceFile, string destinationFolder, string destinationFileName)
{
	Stream fileStream = await GetFileStream(sourceFile);

	if (fileStream != Stream.Null)
	{
		await SaveStream(fileStream, destinationFolder, destinationFileName);
	}
}

async Task<Stream> GetFileStream(string fileUrl)
{
	HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();
	try
	{
		Stream fileStream = await httpClient.GetStreamAsync(fileUrl);
		return fileStream;
	}
	catch (Exception ex)
	{
		return Stream.Null;
	}
}

async Task SaveStream(Stream fileStream, string destinationFolder, string destinationFileName)
{
	if (!Directory.Exists(destinationFolder))
		Directory.CreateDirectory(destinationFolder);

	string path = Path.Combine(destinationFolder, destinationFileName);

	using (FileStream outputFileStream = new FileStream(path, FileMode.CreateNew))
	{
		await fileStream.CopyToAsync(outputFileStream);
	}
}
```
