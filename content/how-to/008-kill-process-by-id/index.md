To retrieve the info about a process given its PID, for example, _85188_, you can use the **PowerShell** command `Get-Process`:

```cmd
Get-Process -ID 85188
```

That will return some info, such as the name of the process:

![Process Info](./get-process-info.png)

And then, to kill it, you can run

```cmd
taskkill /PID 85188 /F
```
