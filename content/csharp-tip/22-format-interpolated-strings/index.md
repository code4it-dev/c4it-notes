summary: "Interpolated strings are those built with the `$` symbol, that you can use to create strings using existing variables or properties. Did you know that you can apply custom formattings to such values?"
---

As you know, there are many ways to "create" strings in C#. You can use a `StringBuilder`, you can simply concatenate strings, or you can use *interpolated* strings.

Interpolated? WHAT? I'm pretty sure that you've already used interpolated strings, even if you did not know the "official" name:

```cs
int age = 31;
string bio = $"Hi, I'm {age} years old";
```

That's it: an interpolated string is the one where you can reference a variable or a property withing the string definition, using the `$` and the `{}` operators to generate such strings.

Did you know that you can even format how the interpolated value must be rendered when creating the string? It's just a matter of specifying the format after the `:` sign:

## Formatting dates

The easiest way to learn it is by formattging dates:

```cs
DateTime date = new DateTime(2021,05,23);

Console.WriteLine($"The printed date is {date:yyyy-MM-dd}"); //The printed date is 2021-05-23
Console.WriteLine($"Another version is {date:yyyy-MMMM-dd}"); //Another version is 2021-May-23

Console.WriteLine($"The default version is {date}"); //The default version is 23/05/2021 00:00:00
```

Here we have `date:yyyy-MM-dd` which basically means "format the `date` variable using the `yyyy-MM-dd` format". 

There are, obviously, different ways to format dates, as described on the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-date-and-time-format-strings). Some of the most useful are:


* `dd`: day of the month, in number (from 01 to 31);
* `ddd`: abbrebiated day name (eg: Mon)
* `dddd`: full day name (eg: Monday)
* `hh`: hour in a 12-hour clock (01-> 12)
* `HH`: hour in a 24-hour clock (00->23)
* `MMMM`: full month day

and so on.

## Formatting numbers

Similar to dates, we can format numbers.

For example, we can format a `double` number as currency or as a percentage:

```cs
var cost = 12.41;
Console.WriteLine($"The cost is {cost:C}"); // The cost is £12.41

var variation = -0.254;
Console.WriteLine($"There is a variation of {variation:P}"); //There is a variation of -25.40%
```

Again, there are lots of different ways to format numbers:

* `C`: currency - it takes the current culture, so it may be Euro, Yen, or whatever currency, depending on the process' culture;
* `E`: exponential number, used for scientific operations
* `P`: percentage: as we've seen before `{1:P}` represents 100%;
* `X`: hexadecimal

## Further readings

There are too many formats that you can use to convert a value to string, and we cannot explore all of them here.

But still, you can have a look at several ways to format date and time in C#

and, obviously, to format numbers

Finally, remember that interpolated strings are not the only way to build strings upon variables; you can (and should!) use `string.Format`:
